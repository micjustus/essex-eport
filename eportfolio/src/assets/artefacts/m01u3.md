  Two different styles of network layouts include *bus* or *star*. Networks come in different configurations such as Wide Area Networks (WAN), Local Area Networks (LAN), Personal Area Networks (PAN) and Metro Area Networks (MAN).

  Patterns for communication over networks include _client/server_ and _peer-to-peer_.  

  Network communications adhere to strict communication protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), Transmission Control Protocol with IP (TCP/IP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Secure Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
