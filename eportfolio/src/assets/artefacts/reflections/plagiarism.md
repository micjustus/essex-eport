## Introduction 

Before starting the **PGCert Computer Science** course, I was not much aware of the impact of "plagiarism" in academic studies. The induction module
allowed me to learn more about this topic and how best to avoid it.

## Topics Studied

**Plagiarism** attempts to deal with a real-world problem in academia (and business too) of **honesty**. Failure to correctly attribute source ideas or thoughts or concepts to their original owners, carries severe penalties for leanring institutions, professors and workers. When researching concerning this topic, I became quite worried about the impact it would have on my ability to complete this course, because it seems so _easy_ to commit academic offence without even intending to do so!

To overcome plagiarism, I settled on the following course of action: 
- **_Always reference any quoted or paraphrased material in academic writing_** 
- **_Where possible, always prefer paraphrasing_**


**Paraphrasing** was rather a difficult topic to grasp because of the nuances of changing sentence structure, tenses and replacing non-generic words. However, the induction assignment helped me to get to grips with the concept of paraphrasing and how to ensure a successful paraphrase.

To perfom better in paraphrasing, my course of action is: **_Understand the context and meaning, then write in your own words_**


**Referencing** I learned that Essex University (Online) wants all cited sources to use the Harvard referencing style. This was a very difficult concept to understand because there are _many_ formats required depending on the source material. Nevertheless, the information provided was useful and helpful in understanding that referencing is not necessarily a difficult requirement to fulfill.

However, annoyances regarding referencing styles persist:

- Each university has their own _style_ for referencing
- Many referencing styles are available

I contemplated why there is not **_ONE standard regardless of industry_**
