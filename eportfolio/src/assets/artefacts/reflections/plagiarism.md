e-portfolios was a concept I have not been exposed to prior to commencing PGCert study. 
This was the opening discussion forum topic raised by the module tutor wherein we were required to discuss and 
research the notion of what is an e-portfolio and what value does it bring to our world.

Researching basic information about what is this concept and the requirements behind maintaing a <em>living</em> electronic
portfolio, I quickly formed First Thoughts that e-portfolios were:
  - Unnecessary
  - Create unrealistic expectations
  - Where do I even begin with one?
