GDPR is governed by the EU's view that every person has a right concerning data that surrounds them: they can 
refuse to have it used or published.

Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is designed to strengthen person's fundamental rights in the digital era and assist
businesses within a single market.

However, there is a balance the EU tries to strike between the rights of an individual and the rights of an 
organisation to conduct business with such individual's data

GDPR is enforced through the enforcement directive Directive (EU) 2016/680. This directive is aimed at law enforcement
entities and how they may use a person's data for law enforcement purposes and aims to protect all persons in a crime, 
the victim, the purpertrator, and suspects

GDPR policies are enforced in EU through the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)

Regulation 2018/1725 dictates the rules involved in processing personal data. These rules are monitored by the supervisor

Consent and legitimate interest are the basis for data processing

Smaller companies have feewer obligations than large companies

GDPR does not impact freedom of the press

All companies operating in the EU are required to abide by GDPR standards

Every additional use of personal data must be consented

Fines are issued on an individual basis based on the extent of the crime

GDPR is flexible framework and can be tailored to the size and requirements of businesses

**Data Processing**
Companies must provide individuals with information
on who is processing what and why. At a minimum, this
information must clearly state:
 who you are;
 why you are processing the data;
 what the legal basis is;
 who will receive the data (if applicable).
In some cases, the information must also state:
 contact information of the DPO;
 legitimate interest (when the legitimate interest is
the legal ground for processing);
 basis for transferring the data to a country outside
the EU;
 how long the data will be stored;
 the individual’s data protection rights (i.e. right to
access, correction, erasure, restriction, objection,
portability, etc.);
 how consent can be withdrawn (when consent is
the legal ground for processing);
 whether there is a statutory or contractual
obligation to provide the data;
 in the case of automated decision-making,
information about the logic, significance and
consequences of the decision.

**Mtyhs Busted**
The GDPR is not a completely brand-new set of EU data protection rules. It’s an evolution
of the existing set of rules, based on the strong data protection principles set out in the
Data Protection Directive. These rules have been around since 1995, so it’s time to make
sure that they’re fit for the digital age.

**Why GDPR**
Citizens have more right over their data
Business benefit from a level playing field


**Success**
ata protection authorities created new tools to
better inform individuals and businesses about the
GDPR, such as seminars and events for data protection officers and SMEs, hotlines for consultations
and templates for processing contracts

GDPR in EU has triggered other such policies in countries around the world:
From Chile to South Korea, to Brazil, to Kenya,
many countries around the world are modernising
their privacy rules. This creates new opportunities
to increase protection for individuals and facilitate
data flows – along GDPR standards. 

In 2019, the mutual EU-Japan Adequacy Decision
has created the largest area of safe and free data
flows in the world, allowing personal data to flow
freely between the two economies on the basis of
strong protection guarantees
