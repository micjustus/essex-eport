## Introduction 

Before starting the **PGCert Computer Science** course, I was not aware of the role of electronic portfolios ("e-portfolio")
This was the topic raised by the module tutor for discussion in the student forum. this topic was designed to get students interacting 
with one another via the forum.

To raise valid points related to this topic, I researched the concept of e-portfolios and quickly formed initial impressions:
  
  - They have not real-world application
  - They set a negative precedent for employers
  - They have no value outside of academia
  - They loose momentum of maintenance beyond studies

From the points above, there is an definite negative attitude against e-portfolios. I shall elaborate further within this article 
about what I've learned so far concerning e-portfolios 

## Technologies 

My bias against e-portfolios is driven by a perception that the IT industry is an ever-increasingly cut-throat industry: eat or be eaten. 
Technologies today are gone tomorrow, and what was old, becomes new but with different facades, for example _Cloud Computing_ (an evolution of mainframe computing). Each individual within the IT field is faced with a plethora of _techologies_ that change _frequently_. It is difficult for even the best-trained amongst in the field to know everything there is concerning the "next-best-thing". Take for example, the different 
front-end frameworks for developing web applications:

  - Angular
  - React
  - Vue.js
  - Ember.js
  - jQuery
  - Backbone.js
  - Svelte (_this looks promising indeed_ :-))
  - ASP.NET

Each technology stack has their own pros and cons and it seems the technologies that stick, are those that enable _faster_ development
with _minimal_ setup or learning curves. 

Since e-portfolios are a showcase of one's skillset *and* academic prowess, Vulcan logic dictates that the "weak will not survive, while the strong will thrive"; a pattern seen in nature. Now if a student maintains an e-portfolio and cannot exhibit a plethora of exposure to all the technological
tools and frameworks in the field, it is very likely that employers would therefore look poorly upon such a hopeful candidate. However, 
if the _same_ e-portfolio referenced all the technologies under the existing sun, then Vulcan logic stands: the holder of such an e-portfolio will
succeed and be hired.

 Which begs the question: __*What of people who never work on exciting projects?*__


## Aesthetics

Web design is a skill I believe many web developers are _not_ born with: it is a skill that has to be honed and developed. Yet, my thoughts lead me
to consider that e-portfolios with the best presentation, have a better chance of elevating the student above other more mundane and run-of-the-mill
portfolios. 

Regarding this, I looked into the concept of why some brands are more successful than others and I came across the idea that 
consistency and _marketing_ are one of the keys to success. For example, L'Oreal's slogan "Maybe she's born with it", or Nike's "Just Do It" slogans
are instantly recognisable and associated with the brand.

## Maintenance

Maintaining an e-portfolio is a difficult task because of balancing the needs to keep it up-to-date with new skills of technologies learned, while
at the same time balancing an ordinary work life. Some students in the discussion forum expressed this concern too. I provided my real-world 
experience that no employers have ever asked to see an e-portfolio. I attribute this to the ability to converse and explain my experience and 
skill set.
