_Unit 1 introduces students to the roles, responsibilities of IT professionals, examines various threats encountered and look at the role of a code of conduct in IT practices._

  **Roles** includes *programmers*, *data analysts*. Basic **skills** include *leadership*, *technical*, *analytical thinking*.
  
  **Threats** include *distributed data*, *data hacking*, *data leaks* (specifically in relation to *intellectual property*), *cyber terrorism*, *data privacy*, breaches in *data confidentiality*, an increase in *always-on* mentality and the adoption of *artifical intelligence*. Such threats have **ethical** and **legal** implications that IT professionals need to address. To mitigate these risks, [link BCS Code of Conduct](https://www.bcs.org/) and [link GDPR Data Protection](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en) regulations were looked at.

This unit encouraged students to discuss ethics of data protection via **GDPR** and their organisation's own **Code of Conduct**.
