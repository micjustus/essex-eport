_Unit 3 addresses the concepts of emerging technologies in Computer Science._

Technologies include **Big Data**, _**Cloud Computing**_, _**Artificial Intelligence**_, _**Social Media**_ and _**Virtual Machines**._

Cloud Computing brings 3 concepts to enable businesses *Software as a Service (SaaS)*, *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*, *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*. Each type of service fulfills specific use-cases within an organisation.

However, IT professionals must be aware that **cyber security threats** are a very real danger to their data and organisations. These threats need to be addressed, such as _Spam_, *Malware*, *viruses*, *phishing emails*, *Denial of Service (DoS)* or *Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)*.

**Networks** form the backbone of communication between devices. These are known as _connected devices_. Connections are enabled via **network hardware** such as *routers*, *switches*, *repeaters* and *bridges*. Collection of connected devices can be arranged in a *bus* or *star* layout. The size of locality of connected devices classifies its **network layout** as *Wide Area Networks (WAN)*, *Local Area Networks (LAN)*, *Personal Area Networks (PAN)* or *Metro Area Networks (MAN)*. 

Connected devices fulfill different roles in their interactions and can be either the _client_ or _server_. Such roles lead to the terms "_client/server_" and "_peer-to-peer_" networking. Connected devices must adhered to strict **communication protocols** such as _Internet Protocol (IP)_, _Transmission Control Protocol with IP (TCP/IP)_, _User Datagram Protocol (UDP)_, and other protocols include _Secure Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)_ in order to successfully exchange information.
