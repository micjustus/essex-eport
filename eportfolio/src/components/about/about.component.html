          Hi, my name is Michael. I am a software architect and software engineer rolled up into a single package of
          usefulness. Software Architecture is an enjoyable passion as it deals with with the <strong>components</strong> and their
          <strong>interactions</strong>. Manipulating the <em>components</em> of a system is a wonderful opportunity to optimise
          business processes and deliver the best software solutions to customers.
